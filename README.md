# üöÄ Retail Vision Platform - Full Stack Docker Compose Demo

## Introduction

This repository contains a full-stack, multi-service demonstration project simulating a small component of a modern retail platform. It showcases a robust, containerized architecture using **Docker Compose** as the orchestration tool for local development and testing.

## üéØ Project Goals and Technical Highlights

This setup specifically addresses several key professional and architectural practices relevant to high-tech environments like TRIGO, which rely on distributed systems, AI, and robust deployment pipelines:

  * **Architectural Maturity (Single Entry Point):** Implements **Nginx** as a **Reverse Proxy (Gateway)**, serving as the single exposed entry point (Port 80). This keeps the internal services (`api`, `ui`) private for enhanced security and simplifies domain management.
  * **Networking and Decoupling:** Services communicate over a custom Docker bridge network (`appnet`) using internal service names (DNS Resolution), demonstrating strong decoupling.
  * **Reliable Startup:** Uses **Postgres Health Checks (`healthcheck`)** and the **`service_healthy`** condition in Docker Compose to ensure the API only attempts to connect to the database once the DB is fully initialized and ready, preventing common startup failures.
  * **CORS Resolution:** Eliminates Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues by routing both the API and UI through the same proxy and host.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture and Components

The application stack consists of four main containers:

| Service | Technology | Internal Port | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`proxy`** | Nginx | 80 | **Gateway:** Handles all incoming traffic, serves the UI, and routes `/api` requests to the Backend. |
| **`ui`** | React / Vite | 5173 | **Frontend:** Displays and manages user data. Accesses the API via the relative path `/api/users`. |
| **`api`** | Express / TS | 8000 | **Backend:** REST API handling user persistence logic and communicating with the database. |
| **`db`** | Postgres:16-alpine | 5432 | **Database:** Provides persistent storage for the user table. |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  * **Docker Desktop:** Installed and running (includes Docker Compose).
  * **Git:** Installed.

### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saluk534/job_find.git
cd job_find
```

### 2\. Launch the Stack

Run the following command to build the application code (`--build`) and start all four services in detached mode (`-d`).

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

*(The Nginx proxy will automatically be configured using the supplied `nginx.conf` and the internal service names (`api`, `ui`))*

### 3\. Access the Application

The entire platform is exposed only through the Nginx gateway on Port 80.

## üß† Technical Deep Dive

### Reverse Proxy Configuration (`nginx.conf`)

The Nginx configuration is essential for routing internal traffic correctly:

| Nginx Location | Action | Internal Destination | Purpose of Rewrite |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`location /api`** | Routes to API | `http://api:8000` | **Crucial:** The `rewrite` rule removes the `/api` prefix so the backend (Express) receives the expected path (`/users`). |
| **`location /`** | Routes to UI | `http://ui:5173` | Serves the frontend static files. |

### Database Health Check

The `db` service is configured with a robust health check:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres"]
  interval: 3s
  # ... other params

depends_on:
  db:
    condition: service_healthy # Wait for DB to be truly ready
```

This configuration ensures system stability by preventing the API from starting up and failing due to a temporary DB connection issue during initialization.

-----

## üêõ Troubleshooting and Debugging

If a service fails, use the following commands to diagnose the issue:

| Command | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `docker compose ps` | View the status of all running containers (look for `unhealthy` or `Exit` status). |
| `docker compose logs [service_name]` | View the logs for a specific service (e.g., `api` or `db`). This will show connection errors or application crashes. |
| `docker exec -it api bash` | Open an interactive shell inside the running `api` container for manual file inspection or testing internal network connectivity (e.g., pinging the `db` service). |

### Shutting Down

To stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes:

```bash
docker compose down
```
